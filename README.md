# Addictiveness Score Prediction

Project Overview : This project focuses on predicting social media addictiveness scores using data analytics and machine learning techniques. The objective is to model the relationship between user behavior attributes such as usage duration, sleep patterns, demographics, and platform preferences to estimate an overall addictiveness score. The project is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook–based analytical workflow, covering data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, and performance evaluation.

Objective :
  - To predict the addictiveness score of individuals based on behavioral and demographic data
  - To identify key factors contributing to higher addiction levels
  - To apply supervised machine learning techniques for regression-based prediction
  - To evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics

Dataset Description :

  - Structured dataset containing student behavioral data
  - Key attributes include:
      1. Age
      2. Gender
      3. Daily social media usage hours
      4. Average sleep duration
      5. Academic level
      6. Platform usage indicators
      7. Historical addiction scores
  - Target Variable:
      1. Addictiveness Score

Tools & Technologies Used :
  1. Python
  2. Jupyter Notebook
  3. Pandas
  4. Matplotlib
  5. Scikit-learn

Project Workflow :

  6. Machine learning model training
  7. Prediction of addictiveness scores
  8. Model evaluation and performance analysis

Machine Learning Approach :
  - Supervised learning methodology
  - LInear Regression-based modeling approach

Model performance evaluated using:
  1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  2. Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  3. R² Score

Key Insights :
1. Daily social media usage hours strongly influence addictiveness scores
2. Reduced sleep duration correlates with higher predicted addiction levels
3. Certain platforms contribute more significantly to addiction severity
4. Behavioral features outperform demographic features in prediction accuracy


Outcome :
  - Accurate prediction of addictiveness scores
  - Identification of high-impact behavioral features
  - End-to-end machine learning workflow implementation
  - Reusable notebook for further experimentation
